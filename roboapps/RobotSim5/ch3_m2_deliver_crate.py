#  Chapter 3  ·  Mission 2 — "To the Drop Zone"
#  Load world:  chapter3_warehouse.py
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  OBJECTIVE
#  ARIA has Crate_1 attached from Mission 1.  Drive her to the
#  blue drop zone (centred at x=7.5, y=7.0) and release the crate
#  inside it.
#
#  NEW CONCEPT
#  ────────────
#  detach()  →  releases the currently held object.
#               The crate stays where ARIA drops it.
#               holding() returns False afterwards.
#
#  THE MISSION
#  ───────────
#  1. Complete Mission 1 first to attach Crate_1.
#     Then run this script immediately (ARIA still holds the crate).
#
#  2. Watch the crate travel with ARIA across the warehouse.
#
#  3. After detach(), manually drive ARIA away.
#     Does the crate stay put?  (It should — physics is "moveable"
#     but no force is applied once detached.)
#
#  WHAT TO OBSERVE
#  ───────────────
#  The drop zone is marked by 4 small blue cylinders at its corners.
#  ARIA needs to be INSIDE the square when she calls detach().
#  The zone is 2 m × 2 m — plenty of room.
#
#  KEY INSIGHT
#  Notice the sequence of moves below uses the same drive() +
#  time.sleep() pattern from Chapter 1 — but now with cargo.
#  The robot's behaviour (moving) doesn't change; what changes is
#  that she carries a crate.  Abstraction in action.
#
#  CHALLENGE
#  After delivering, go back and collect Crate_2 (at x=7.0, y=4.0)
#  and bring it to the same drop zone.  Write the navigation steps
#  yourself.  Then think: can this be made into a function?
