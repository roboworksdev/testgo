#  Chapter 3  ·  Mission 3 — "Teach ARIA a New Skill"
#  Load world:  chapter3_warehouse.py
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  OBJECTIVE
#  The sequential grab-and-deliver code from Missions 1 and 2 works —
#  but only for one crate, and only if you rewrite it four times.
#  In this mission you extract the repetition into a FUNCTION so
#  the whole skill can be called in one line.
#
#  WHY FUNCTIONS?
#  ──────────────
#  def collect_crate(cx, cy):   ← teaches ARIA a new skill
#      ...
#
#  collect_crate(3.5, 4.0)     ← ARIA uses the skill once
#  collect_crate(7.0, 4.0)     ← ... and again
#
#  One definition.  Many uses.  If you want to change the delivery
#  zone, you change it in ONE place inside the def block.
#  This is why functions exist.
#
#  PARAMETERS (preview — covered fully in Chapter 4)
#  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  cx and cy are INPUT VALUES passed to the function when called.
#  Think of them as 'blank slots' that get filled in on each call:
#    collect_crate(3.5, 4.0)  →  cx=3.5, cy=4.0
#    collect_crate(7.0, 4.0)  →  cx=7.0, cy=4.0
#
#  THE MISSION
#  ───────────
#  1. Read the function definitions below.  Can you trace what each
#     one does before running the script?
#
#  2. Run the script.  Does ARIA collect both crates?
#
#  3. Uncomment lines at the bottom to collect Crates 3 and 4.
#     Do you need to change the function?  (You shouldn't.)
#
#  KEY INSIGHT
#  'Once you teach ARIA a skill, she knows it forever.'
#  The def block is the teaching.  The call is the doing.
#  A function is a named, reusable piece of behaviour.
#
#  ASSESSMENT CHALLENGE
#  Write:  def return_to_base():
#  ARIA drives from wherever she is back to (2.0, 2.0).
#  Hint: use distance() readings to navigate, not fixed sleep times.

#    For a full solution, use LiDAR-based navigation (Chapter 6).
