#
#  OBJECTIVE
#  Navigate ARIA to Crate_1 (the nearest orange crate, NE of start)
#  and magnetically attach to it.
#
#  NEW CONCEPTS
#  ────────────
#  close_enough()  →  returns True when a moveable object is within
#                     0.65 m of ARIA's surface.  Use it to know when
#                     to stop approaching and attach.
#
#  attach()        →  couples ARIA to the nearest object.
#                     Nothing happens if no object is close_enough().
#
#  holding()       →  returns True if ARIA is currently carrying
#                     an attached object.
#
#  THE MISSION
#  ───────────
#  1. Run this script.  Watch ARIA navigate to the orange crate
#     and attach.  The crate should lock onto ARIA.
#
#  2. Read the console.  What does  holding()  return before and
#     after  attach() ?
#
#  3. Drive ARIA manually (W/A/S/D keys) after the script ends.
#     Does the crate move with her?
#
#  KEY INSIGHT
#  while not close_enough(): drive(0.2, 0.0)
#  ──────────────────────────────────────────
#  ARIA approaches slowly until the sensor says she's near enough.
#  This is closed-loop control — she adapts to the real distance,
#  not a fixed sleep time.  The approach always works, regardless
#  of exact timing.
#
#  CHALLENGE
#  Can you navigate ARIA to Crate_2 (at x=7.0, y=4.0) instead?
#  Hint: change the navigation steps in Part 1.
