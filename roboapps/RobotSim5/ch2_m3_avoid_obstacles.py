#
#  OBJECTIVE
#  ARIA must reach the orange Sensor_Charger in the NE corner of
#  the room — without touching a single obstacle.  She has no map.
#  She must sense, decide, and act on every step.
#
#  THE CONTROL LOOP
#  ────────────────
#  SENSE:   read distance(0)           ← what's ahead?
#  DECIDE:  if < SAFE: turn; else: go  ← decide what to do
#  ACT:     drive()                    ← execute the decision
#
#  This three-step pattern (Sense → Decide → Act) is the
#  foundation of ALL reactive robotics.
#
#  THE MISSION
#  ───────────
#  1. Run this script.  Watch ARIA navigate.
#     Does she reach the orange charger?
#
#  2. Add a print() inside the loop to watch ARIA's readings:
#       print(f"step={step}  gap={distance(0):.2f}")
#     What distance values trigger a turn?
#
#  3. Change  SAFE = 0.9  to  SAFE = 0.5  and run again.
#     ARIA waits until obstacles are very close before turning.
#     Does she collide more often?
#
#  4. Change  SAFE = 1.8  and run again.
#     ARIA turns very early.  Does she still reach the charger?
#
#  KEY INSIGHT
#  RIGHT BIAS (drive(0.4, 0.15)) makes ARIA drift clockwise.
#  In a square room, clockwise drift eventually brings the robot
#  to the NE corner — where the charger lives.
#  This is not intelligence; it is geometry.
#
#  EXTENSION
#  Replace the fixed bias with sensor-guided steering:
#    if distance(90) > distance(270):
#        drive(0.4, 0.2)   # more open on right — drift right
#    else:
#        drive(0.4, -0.2)  # more open on left  — drift left
#  Does ARIA reach the charger more reliably?
